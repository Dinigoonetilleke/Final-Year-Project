AI-Based Essay Error Classification System



Overview

My final year project builds a machine learning model to categorize English grammatical errors into six main categories.



Dataset

\- Source: Kaggle Grammar Error Dataset

\- Total rows 1919

\- Classes:

&nbsp; - Grammar

&nbsp; - Sentence Structure

&nbsp; - Preposition/Article

&nbsp; - Word Usage

&nbsp; - Punctuation

&nbsp; - Spelling



Model

\- TF-IDF (word + character n-grams)

\- Logistic Regression classifier

\- 80/20 stratified split



Current Performance

\- Accuracy: ~57%

\- Character n-grams improved punctuation detection



Future Improvements

\- Hybrid rule-based spelling detection

\- Optimization
